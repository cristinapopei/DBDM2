Project for the subject of Data Mining in IST autumn semester 2023-2024 at INSA Lyon.

We were tasked with choosing 2 real datasets from the web and performing various operations:
1. Preprocessing;
2. Classification;
3. Clustering.

The two datasets we chose to work with were: The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and The Top 1000 IMDB Movies from Kaggle.
Each of the datasets was throughly preprocessed.
